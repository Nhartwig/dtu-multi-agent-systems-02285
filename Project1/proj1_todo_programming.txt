Project 1 Notes:

programming tasks

un-informed search strategies (BFS/DFS optimized & unoptimized) {

* exercise 1: basic, benchmarking
	-implement strategyDFS class to enable Depth First Search
 
* exercise 2: optimizations
	-modify State class to reduce less memory 

}

informed search strategies ( using heuristics) {

* exercise 4: heuristics
	- implement StrategyBestFirst class
	- implement a heuristic function h(n)
	(greedy & A* are eval functions f(n): f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
	g(n) = cost of n, h(n) = approx. cost to goal from n) 
}
